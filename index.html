      Sanderson has filled The Way of Kings with many varied and memorable
      characters. In addition to the main players already stated, notable
      standout mentions go to the members of Bridge Four who go on an amazing
      transformation during this book. These include Rock, Sigzil, Moash, and
      Teft. Another player I should mention is the mysterious and
      riddle-weaving Wit. I’m not an expert of Sanderson’s Cosmere, but Wit
      may be a character that transcends some of the author’s series. He has
      an extremely memorable scene with Kaladin and a flute-like instrument,
      and I’m extremely intrigued to see what part he will play in the overall
      story arc of The Stormlight Archive. >Although I may unfairly only be
      rating this 9/10, there is something truly spectacular on show here. I
      believe that in fifty years time<span id="show-more-commas-first">...</span><Span class="moreText2">. The
        Stormlight
        Archive will be revered
        and alongside Malazan Book of the Fallen, A Song of Ice and Fire, and
        The Realm of the Elderlings, it will be used to show what the finest
        authors in this generation of fantasy when at the very top of their game
        could achieve. This series is always one of my first recommendations for
        someone wanting to try adult fantasy too so if you haven’t started this
        series yet, now is a perfect time.

      This story takes place in a dystopian-esque world where there are brown
      leaves and a red sun, worshiping anyone but their dictator/god is
      treasonous and terrifying mist is everywhere. The general populace is
      scared of going out into this, but many nobles are Mistings, with the
      ability to burn Allomantic metals, granted to their ancestors by the
      Lord Ruler. Those with this power can either burn one or all of them-
      the latter group are known as Mistborns<span id="show-more-commas-second">...</span><span class="moreText">. The
        peasant group- the Skaa- have been suppressed for a thousand years
        but a new revolt finally offers hope- led by a rare half-Noble and
        rarer Skaa Mistborn. The world building in this story is second to
        none, Sanderson really dives right into it. It’s confusing at first,
        but things start to fall together, although you definitely need to pay
        attention! My main problem was some of the fight/training scenes. They
        are written well, but just personally I struggle with those types of
        scenes generally and there are a lot of them in this first book as
        Vin’s learning about Allomancy. I didn’t know about the chart at the
        back until I’d finished, so I recommend anyone who hasn’t read it yet
        keepinga bookmark in that to prevent confusion!
